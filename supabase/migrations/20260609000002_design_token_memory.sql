-- Design Token Memory — extends project_memory with design_token type
-- Allows Huggy to persist the visual design system (colors, fonts, radii,
-- spacing) per project so UI is visually consistent across generations.

-- The project_memory table already exists (20260609000001).
-- We only need to ensure the CHECK constraint allows the new type.
-- Supabase doesn't support ALTER CHECK directly, so we use a trigger approach.

-- Add design_token as an accepted memory_type by recreating the check constraint.
-- Safe to run multiple times (idempotent DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS).
