      ['Why Huggy exists', 'Most people do not fail because they lack ideas. They fail because turning an idea into a working product is slow, fragmented and intimidating. Huggy is built to make that first product loop clearer: explain the goal, inspect the context, generate the app, verify it, improve it and publish only when the owner chooses.'],
      ['What makes it different', 'Huggy is product-led instead of demo-led. The builder keeps the chat, preview, project files, database notes, usage and publish workflow together so non-technical founders and teams can understand what is happening without pretending to be engineers.'],
      ['How we build trust', 'The agent is designed to ask before acting when intent is unclear, keep published apps stable until Publish is clicked, avoid exposing internal costs or provider data, and make generated output inspectable instead of mysterious.']

      ['Builder workspace', 'The workspace keeps chat, streaming steps, preview, code, database notes, analysis and publish status together. Users can see what changed, stop a generation, continue iterating and keep the live app stable until they publish.'],
      ['Quality and launch flow', 'Generated apps are checked for safe paths, usable preview output, basic SEO structure, responsive behavior and obvious runtime issues. Huggy then supports publish status, Huggy-domain URLs, custom-domain planning and free-plan attribution.']
